# QtClientServerSql Sunflower Production
So, two programs were developed in C++ using the Qt framework. One program serves as the client, while the other serves as the server. The TCP/IP protocol is used to establish communication between them. The server, in turn, connects to the PostgreSQL database. Its main table contains information about sunflower production in Ukraine.

Using a client-server system, various operations can be performed on the database. Specifically, inserting new data, updating existing data, and deleting unnecessary data.

This system allows for selection where the magnitude of gross revenue exceeds 6.5 million tons.
Additionally, the system can calculate the average annual production based on the available data in the database.
